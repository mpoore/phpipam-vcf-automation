# phpIPAM integration for VMware VCF Automation 8.x

This integration allows VMware VCF Automation 8.x to use [phpIPAM](https://phpipam.net) for assigning static IP addresses to provisioned virtual machines and on-demand networks.

## About VMware VCF Automation

VMware VCF Automation (formerly known as VMware Aria Automation and vRealize Automation) is VMwareâ€™s enterprise-grade platform for automating the deployment, configuration, and lifecycle management of cloud and on-premises infrastructure. It enables organizations to deliver infrastructure and application services consistently and at scale, leveraging policy-based governance and self-service capabilities.

A feature of VCF Automation is its integration with IP Address Management (IPAM) solutions, such as phpIPAM or Infoblox, allowing automated allocation, tracking, and management of IP addresses during the provisioning of virtual networks and workloads. This ensures IP consistency, avoids conflicts, and streamlines network automation workflows within VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) environments.

## About phpIPAM

[phpIPAM](https://phpipam.net/) is an open-source IP address management (IPAM) solution designed to help organizations efficiently manage and track their IPv4 and IPv6 address space. Built with PHP, MySQL, and jQuery, it provides a modern and user-friendly web interface for managing subnets, IP addresses, VLANs, VRFs, and related network resources.

phpIPAM is lightweight, easy to deploy, and integrates well with network automation workflows, making it ideal for both small labs and large-scale enterprise environments.
